# Tennis Technique AI Model

**Model Used to Extract Data:** YOLOv7 ([link to YOLOv7 repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/tree/main))

## Project Description

This project aims to empower tennis players to improve their technique independently, without relying solely on coaching availability. I developed two AI models for this purpose:

1. **Swing Classification Model**: This model classifies a tennis swing as "good" or "bad" based on certain technical aspects.
2. **Swing Overlay Model**: This model predicts an optimal swing path for the player and overlays a skeleton representation of this path onto the playerâ€™s video.

Users only need to provide the path to their video file, with all other parameters set to default. The video input should meet the following requirements:
- **Angle**: Side view
- **Content**: Single stroke per video (e.g., one forehand swing)

This is an example of a good video file:

Currently, this model supports only **right-handed forehand swings**. I plan to expand it to other strokes as I gather more data. Please note that this project is still in development, with the swing classification model achieving approximately **80% accuracy**. The overlay model is functional but requires further refinement for optimal accuracy.

**Note**: These models take quite a while to run depending on video length so please be patient if you don't see any output immediately. If all instructions are followed correctly, these models should work.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [THIS REPOSITORY URL]
   cd [YOUR PROJECT FOLDER]
   ```

2. **Download the YOLOv7 Model**:
   - Download the YOLOv7 model weights and place them in the project directory. Follow the instructions from the YOLOv7 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/tree/main) to download the model.

3. **Create Folder to Store Data**:
   - Create an empty folder called Tests in the folder you cloned this repo to
  
4. **Setup**:
   - Open a program where you can run Python code like Jupyter Notebook in this folder
   - Run the following commands in this exact order:
     - This will install the neccesary packages

       ```python
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
     - This will load the YOLOv7 model we will be using to extract data from the videos
       ```python
       from Setup import *
       model = get_model()
       ```
   - You should now be in the yolov7 folder, you can check to make sure by running
   ```python
   print(os.getcwd())
   ```
   - Run the following commands:
     - ```python
       from Classification import classify_swing
       ```
     - ```python
       from Overlay import overlay_swing_path
       ```
3. **Run the Models**:
   Follow the instructions below for using both models.

## AI Swing Classification Model

1. **Function Call**:
   - Run the classification model by calling the `classify_swing` function.
   - **Parameters**: Pass the paths of the video files you want to classify as an argument in a list format.
   - Example:
     ```python
     classify_swing(["path/to/your/video.mp4", "path/to/your/video.mp4"], model)
     ```

2. **Output**:
   - The model will output whether the swing is classified as "good" or "bad" with an 80% accuracy level.

## AI Swing Overlay Model

1. **Function Call**:
   - Run the overlay model by calling the `overlay_swing_path` function.
   - **Parameters**: Pass the path of the video file as an argument.
   - Example:
     ```python
     overlay_swing_path("path/to/your/video.mp4", model)
     ```

2. **Output**:
   - The model will return the path of the output video file, which is the original video with the predicted swing path overlayed on the player, showing the suggested optimal swing.

## Future Improvements
I am working to improve both models by gathering more data and fine-tuning model parameters. Upcoming features include:
- Support for left-handed players
- Additional stroke types (backhand, serve, etc.)
- Improved classification and overlay accuracy

This project is intended for players looking to refine their technique with minimal input from external coaches. **Note**: While the models provide guidance, they are not a substitute for professional coaching and should be used as supplementary tools for improvement.
