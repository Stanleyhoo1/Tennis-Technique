# Tennis Technique AI Model

**Model Used:** YOLOv7 ([link to YOLOv7 repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/tree/main))

## Project Description

This project aims to empower tennis players to improve their technique independently, without relying solely on coaching availability. I developed two AI models for this purpose:

1. **Swing Classification Model**: This model classifies a tennis swing as "good" or "bad" based on certain technical aspects.
2. **Swing Overlay Model**: This model predicts an optimal swing path for the player and overlays a skeleton representation of this path onto the playerâ€™s video.

Users only need to provide the path to their video file, with all other parameters set to default. The video input should meet the following requirements:
- **Angle**: Side view
- **Content**: Single stroke per video (e.g., one forehand swing)
  
Currently, this model supports only **right-handed forehand swings**. I plan to expand it to other strokes as I gather more data. Please note that this project is still in development, with the swing classification model achieving approximately **80% accuracy**. The overlay model is functional but requires further refinement for optimal accuracy.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR REPOSITORY URL]
   cd [YOUR PROJECT FOLDER]
   ```

2. **Download the YOLOv7 Model**:
   - Download the YOLOv7 model weights and place them in the project directory. Follow the instructions from the YOLOv7 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/tree/main) to download the model.

3. **Run the Models**:
   Follow the instructions below for using both models.

## AI Swing Classification Model

1. **Function Call**:
   - Run the classification model by calling the `classify_swing` function (replace this with your function name if different).
   - **Parameters**: Pass the path of the video file as an argument.
   - Example:
     ```python
     classify_swing("path/to/your/video.mp4")
     ```

2. **Output**:
   - The model will output whether the swing is classified as "good" or "bad" with an 80% accuracy level.

## AI Swing Overlay Model

1. **Function Call**:
   - Run the overlay model by calling the `overlay_swing_path` function (replace this with your function name if different).
   - **Parameters**: Pass the path of the video file as an argument.
   - Example:
     ```python
     overlay_swing_path("path/to/your/video.mp4")
     ```

2. **Output**:
   - The model will display the original video with the predicted swing path overlayed on the player, showing the suggested optimal swing.

## Future Improvements
I am working to improve both models by gathering more data and fine-tuning model parameters. Upcoming features include:
- Support for left-handed players
- Additional stroke types (backhand, serve, etc.)
- Improved classification and overlay accuracy

This project is intended for players looking to refine their technique with minimal input from external coaches. **Note**: While the models provide guidance, they are not a substitute for professional coaching and should be used as supplementary tools for improvement.
